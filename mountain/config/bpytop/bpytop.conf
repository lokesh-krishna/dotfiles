background_update=True

#* Custom cpu model name, empty string to disable.
custom_cpu_name=""

#* Optional filter for shown disks, should be full path of a mountpoint, separate multiple values with a comma ",".

disks_filter=""

#* Show graphs instead of meters for memory values.
mem_graphs=True

#* If swap memory should be shown in memory box.
show_swap=True

#* Show swap as a disk, ignores show_swap value above, inserts itself after first disk.
swap_disk=True

#* If mem box should be split to also show disks info.
show_disks=True

#* Filter out non physical disks. Set this to False to include network disks, RAM disks and similar.
only_physical=True

#* Read disks list from /etc/fstab. This also disables only_physical.
